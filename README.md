### Abstract

> Modern-day Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) have come a long way from the early text editing utilities to 
> the complex programs encompassing thousands of functions to help developers. However, with the increasing number of 
> efficiency-enhancing tools incorporated, IDEs gradually became sophisticated software with a steep learning curve. 
> The rise of the Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of both natural language dialogue and code generation leads 
> to a discourse on the obsolescence of the concept of IDE. 
> In this work, we offer a view on the place of the LLMs in the IDEs as the universal interface wrapping 
> the IDE facilities. We envision a model that is able to perform complex actions involving multiple 
> IDE features upon user command, stripping the user experience of the tedious work involved in searching 
> through options and actions. For the practical part of the work, we engage with the works exploring the ability 
> of LLMs to call for external tools to expedite a given task execution. 
> We showcase a proof-of-concept of such a tool.
